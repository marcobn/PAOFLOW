This card is mandatory and specifies the details about hamiltonian blocks to be 
used in transport calculation. It includes a variable number of subtags (XML format)
to be used in the order shown below. The name and the number of these subcards 
depend on the calculation_type variable:

       if ( calculation_type == "bulk")      --> two subcards are needed
                                                 <H00_C>, <H_CR>
       if ( calculation_type == "conductor") --> seven subcards are needed

              specify a different file to read the data.

              re-define the index of the R vector [crystal units along
