#
# ENVIRONMENT variables
#
#================================================================
#
# Contains the common variables to be set by the user
# before running tests.
#
# These variables are:
#
# DFT_BIN       the directory contining the executables of
#               DFT package    
# TMPDIR        the directory where massive data are written
#               during the calculation (scratch dir)
#               This dir must be created by the user and the 
#               run script just makes one sub-dir for each test
# PARA_PREFIX   for parallel architectures the MPI launch sintax
# PARA_POSTFIX  must be specified by setting these two variables,
#               (PARA_PREFIX could be mpirun, mpprun, poe ..., and 
#               PARA_POSTFIX could handle some information about 
#               processor number, etc etc)
#               Leave them empty for serial machines or when not needed 
#
#================================================================
# ***** modify the following variables according to your env *****
#

QE_BIN=~/espresso-5.1/bin
ABINIT_BIN=~/codes/abinit-7.6.3/built/src/98_main/
#
TMPDIR=/scratch/ferretti/want

PARA_PREFIX="mpiexec -np 8"
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
PARA_POSTFIX= 

export OMP_NUM_THREADS

#      ***** usually, do NOT modify below this line ***** 
#================================================================
#
# Here other environment variables are set, but for internal use
# only. The modification of these variables is usually NOT required
#
# WANT_BIN         the location of WanT executables
# UTILITY_BIN      the location of utility tools
#
# INPUT_TYPE       defines the type of input used:
#                  "from_file"        use the -input flag to read input
#                                     useful for some parallel environment
#                  "from_sdtin"       use the "<" redirection      (DEFAULT)
#                  *                  whatever other string is directly used
# VERBOSITY_LEVEL  defines the level of verbosity for test check script.
#                  Allowed values: "high", "low".   
#                  "high"     report differences in the whole files,
#                             including iterative output at each step
#                  "low"      try to focus only on the final results
#
# PLOT_SWITCH      whether plot calculation are performed or not
#                  Allowed values: "yes", "no"
# 

WANT_BIN="`pwd`/../../bin"
UTILITY_BIN="`pwd`/../../script"
INPUT_TYPE="from_file"
VERBOSITY_LEVEL="low"
PLOT_SWITCH="yes"
