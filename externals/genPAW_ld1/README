Hi guys,

the definition of a simple and general strategy to generate pseudos with extended basis required some extra work and a slight modification of the ld1 code by Davide.

This is what you have to do:
1) substitute the export_upf.f90 file in the atomic/src dir and recopile the ld1 code
NOTE: this patch is for the 6.1 version only.


let's suppose you want to include the 3s, 3p and 3d wavefunctions for C pseudo

2) copy from the pslibrary the input of the pseudo you want to generate (e.g. C.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.in taken as the reference)

3) Add in the config string the orbitals you wanna add with zero occupancy (see C.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0_ext.in)
4) add the two flags
  lgipaw_reconstruction = .true. !add for extended basis
  use_paw_as_gipaw=.false.       !add for extended basis
in the &inputp name list

5) add the name list
&test
/

NOTE: no other flags are required in the test namelist.

6) add the number and the list of all the wavefunctions that you want to be writte in the pseudo.
set 0 for occupation of empty orbitals. Use a reference energy >0 for unoccupied states.
NOTE: pay attention to the correct numbering of the wavefunctions! see INPUT_ld1 for details

7) run ld1.d with this modified input, pray, and use the pseudo!
that's it. No other python scripts are nececessary anymore.

ciao
arrigo
