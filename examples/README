example01 : Si with spd pseudpotential
example02 : Al with spd pseudpotential
example03 : Pt with lsda (nspin = 2)
example04 : Fe non collinear with spin orbit - Anomalous Hall conductivity
example05 : Pt non collinear with spin orbit - Spin Hall conductivity
example06 : AlP with non self consistent ACBN0
example07 : Al starting from projections with overlap matrix of the atomic orbital (prior to orthogonalization)


Use the 'main.py' in this directory to run PAOFLOW with an xml input file ('inputfile.xml'). Place 'main.py' and the inputfile in the same directory and execute PAOFLOW in one of the standard ways:
python main.py
python main.py <work_directory>
python main.py <work_directory> <inputfile_name>

mpirun -np <num_cores> python main.py

The options have default values:
<work_directory> - './'
<inputfile_name> - 'inputfile.xml'



!! This section is currently under construction !!

Simply run all the tests: 
python run_test.py

This is equivalent to:
python run_test.py 'example*' 'Reference'

Specify pattern for selecting directories containing independent examples or tests:
python run_test.py [example directory pattern] [reference directory pattern]

[example directory pattern] and [reference directory pattern] are optional
arguments and have respective default values: 'example*' and 'Reference'

The reference directory must be located inside the directory containing inputfile.xml.


Tests are verified with 'check_test.py' automatically.

'check_test.py' can be run independently with:
python check_test.py [example directory pattern] [reference directory pattern]
