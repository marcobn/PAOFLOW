GENERAL NOTES ON INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Anaconda package is recommended for PAOFLOW. mpi4py is a prerequisite which must be installed through the conda package manager or installed manually.

Python:
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh

MPI:
conda install mpi4py


Automatic installation through PyPI:

pip install PAOFLOW

Instruction for manual install of PAOFLOW:
pip install .

If you dont have administrator privilages for your python distribution
pip install --user .

Optional dependencies for the Weyl Search feature are listed in pyproject.toml. They can be installed through PyPI as follows:
pip install PAOFLOW[weyl_search]
or manually as
pip install .[weyl_search]

To install in editable mode, add the -e flag to any of the manual install commands, for example:
pip install -e .
This will reflect code changes without having to reinstall.
Note however that you would need to restart the interpreter, or the notebook if you are using Jupyter.

Intel Distribution for python:

About an order of magnitude in performance boost obtained by installing the Intel distribution for python on my local DELL PowerEdge T630:

The same installation does not seem to improve the performance of python on Stampede (UTexas)
or Talon2 (UNT).
