--------------------------------------------------------------------
WanT can take advantage of several optimized numerical libraries
(essl, fftw, mkl...).  This configure script attempts to find them,
but may fail if they have been installed in non-standard locations.

The following libraries have been found:

  @blas_line@
  @lapack_line@
  @fft_line@
  @iotk_line@
  @mpi_line@
  @mass_line@
  @etsf_io_line@
  @netcdf_line@
  @cuda_line@
  @phigemm_line@
  @magma_line@

Please check if that is correct.

If any libraries are missing, you may specify a list of directories
to search and retry, as follows:
  ./configure LIBDIRS="list of directories, separated by spaces"

For more info, read the WanT Manual (docs/want_manual.pdf).
