@title@   CP2K and ATMPROJ Hamiltonians
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  This test shows how to use CP2K and ATMPROJ Hamiltonians to interpolate
  the electronic structure of few selected systems. Bands, dos, and transmittance
  are computed and compared with direct calculations.

  A number of systems are tested: bulk Silicon, poly-acethylene chains, gold chains,
  and the benzene molecule.
  The geometry of polyacetylene is taken from van Faassen et al, PRL 88 186401 (2002),
  corresponding to a HF relaxation.
  (results for the same PA system obtained using the crystal code are given in test13)
