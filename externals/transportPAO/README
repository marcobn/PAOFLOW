==========================
   PAOtransport - a utility to calculate ballistic quantum transport using
   Hamiltonians from the Projections of DFT wfc on Atomic Orbital (PAO) bases
==========================

The development and maintenance of the PAOtransport code is promoted by: 

  * the ERMES group at the University of North Texas
    (http://ermes.unt.edu) 

The present release of the package has been realized
by Marco Buongiorno Nardelli, Jan. 2017.

PAOtransport original release was as part of the WanT code. See www.wannier-transport.org
for details and historic development information
