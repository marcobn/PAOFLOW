 PAOFLOW's capabilities:

 - Construction of PAO Hamiltonians from the DFT wavefunctions onto pseudo atomic orbitals
 - Construction of PAO Hamiltonians from analytical tight binding models
 - Hamiltonian data for further processing (ACBN0, PAOtransport, etc.)
 - Calculation of the Hubbard-U parameter through the ACBN0 method
 - External fields and non scf ACBN0 correction
 - Spin orbit correction of non SO calculations
 - Bands along standard paths in the BZ
 - Real space electronic charge density
 - Interpolation of Hamiltonians on arbitrary Monkhorst and Pack k-meshes
 - Adaptive smearing for BZ and Fermi surface integration
 - Density of states (and projected DOS)
 - Fermi surfaces and spin textures
 - Boltzmann transport (conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electronic contribution to thermal conductivity
 - dielectric function (absorption coefficients and EELS)
 - Berry curvature and anomalous Hall conductivity (including magnetic circular dichroism spectra)
 - spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity (including spin circular dichroism spectra) 
 - Band topology (Z2 invariants, Berry and spin Berry curvature along standard paths in BZ, critical points
