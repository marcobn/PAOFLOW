@title@   Ballistic phonon transport: poly-acethylene
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  This test shows how to perform a phonon transport calculation
  on a 1-dimensional polymer (poly-acethylene).
  This test is meant to show how to combine the Phonon and WanT 
  to compute phonon transport.

  JOB SEQUENCE:
  pw.x < cnhn.scf.in 
  	run pw.x 
  ph.x < cnhn.ph.in
    	run ph.x
  q2trans.x < cnhn.q2trans.in
  	extract the matrix of the interatomic force constants, 
        and writes it in the format for conductor.x (ext.ham)
  conductor.x < cnhn.cond.in
  	computes the phonon transmittance
	
NOTE: the input parameters (ecutwfc etc.) or q-grid are somewhat under 
converged for the sake of fast execution (CAVEAT: this test takes a 
LONG time to run on a workstation). For the testing of the transport 
part we have saved the dynamical and IFC matrices in reference/.

NOTE2: for accurate phonon calculations on these systems, ecutrho=20*ecuwfc, 
else instabilities appear in the long wavelength acoustic modes.
